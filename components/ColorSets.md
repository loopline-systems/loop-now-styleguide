These are the matching color sets mostly used for the scales. 
Depending how many colors you need you can access them through
the **orderedColorsSets**. There is no component for the usage of the color sets.
They are accessable directly from the Object.
Please ignore the component which is used for this example.

```js
  <ColorSets/>
```
